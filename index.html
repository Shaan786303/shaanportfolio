            <h3>Web Development</h3>
            <p>Web development is the building and maintenance of websites
                it is the work that happens behind the scenes to make a website look great,
                work fast and perform well with a seamless user experience.
                Web developers, do this by using a variety of coding languages.
                Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet
                or an intranet (a private network).<span id="dot-1"></span>
                <span id="more-1">
                  There are two types of Web Developers:-<br><br>
                  1. Frontend Developers<br><br>
                  A front-end developer creates websites and applications using web languages such as HTML, CSS, and
                  JavaScript that allow users to access and interact with the site or app.
                  When you visit a website, the design elements you see were created by a front-end developer.<br><br>
                  2. Backend Developers<br><br>
                  A back-end development means working on server-side software,
                  which focuses on everything you can't see on a website.
                  Back-end developers ensure the website performs correctly, focusing on databases, back-end logic,
                  application programming interface (APIs), architecture, and servers.<br><br>
                  And the person who know both the fronted and backend part is known as Full Stack Web Developer. 
                  To Become a successful web developer we need to learn any one of the above.
                  We can build our career by either learning Frontend or Backend.

            <h3>Android Development</h3>
            <p>Back-end development means working on server-side software,
                which focuses on everything you can't see on a website.
                Back-end developers ensure the website performs correctly, focusing on databases,
                back-end logic, application programming interface (APIs), architecture, and servers.
                Google sponsored the project at initial stages and in the year 2005, it acquired the whole company.<span id="dot-2"></span>
                <span id="more-2">
                    In September 2008, the first Android-powered device was launched in the market.
                    Android dominates the mobile OS industry because of the long list of features it provides.
                    It’s user-friendly, has huge community support, provides a greater extent of customization,
                    and a large number of companies build Android-compatible smartphones.<br><br>
                    As a result, the market observes a sharp increase in the demand for developing Android mobile applications,
                    and with that companies need smart developers with the right skill set. At first,
                    the purpose of Android was thought of as a mobile operating system.
                    However, with the advancement of code libraries and its popularity among developers of the divergent domain,
                    Android becomes an absolute set of software for all devices like tablets, wearables,
                    set-top boxes, smart TVs, notebooks, etc.

            <h3>Content Writing</h3>
            <p>Content writing is the process of writing, editing, and publishing content in a digital format.
                That content can include blog posts, video or podcast scripts, ebooks or whitepapers, press releases,
                product category descriptions, landing page or social media copies and more.
                A Content Writer is a professional who writes informative and engaging articles to help brands showcase their product.<span id="dot-3"></span>
                <span id="more-3">
                Business professionals often hire content writers to produce high-quality messages for sales copy, blogs,
                articles, and social media posts. The writer must understand the audience to write successful copy that appeals
                to them.<br><br>
                Search engines like Google update their algorithms constantly to ensure users receive the high-quality content for which they’re searching.
                SEO-savvy writers understand how these changes affect business content and adjust their strategies accordingly.
                They employ techniques that drive results, and when best practices change, they go back and make modifications to existing copy.
                This ensures content is optimized for the latest set of standards.

            <h3>Video Editor</h3>
            <p>A video editor is the person who makes production and/or post-production changes to a film.
            The video editor works closely with the director to achieve the best final film outcome,
            with the goal of telling the story in the most effective and compelling way.
            Work heavily involves cutting and rearranging scenes.<span id="dot-4"></span>
            <span id="more-4">
            A good editor will be cognizant of the audio track as much as the video track, and in some situations,
            even more so. Being slightly off with audio timing, especially with dialogue, is even easier to pick up on than with the visual cut.
            A Video Editor, or Video Production Editor, is responsible for reviewing audio and visual footage and using computer software to organize clips into a cohesive unit.<br><br>
            Corporations use Video Editors to work on company training films or hire people to edit commercials. Music videos are another possibility.
            Many businesses use videos on social media to sell products, and these businesses often contract for services.<br><br>
            Video editing is both a rewarding profession and useful skill for personal use.
            Outside of professional work, video editing skills can be used for personal projects ranging from family
            occasions to sporting events that are captured on video, with editing skills allowing you to share higher quality projects.

            <h3>Graphics Designing</h3>
            <p>A graphic designer is a professional within the graphic design and graphic arts industry who assembles together images,
                typography, or motion graphics to create a piece of design. A graphic designer creates the graphics primarily for published,
                printed, or electronic media, such as brochures and advertising.<span id="dot-5"></span>
                <span id="more-5">
                    According to the  American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA), graphic design is defined as
                    “the art and practice of planning and projecting ideas and experiences with visual and textual content.”
                    In other terms, graphic design communicates certain ideas or messages in a visual way.
                    These visuals can be as simple as a business logo, or as complex as page layouts on a website.<br><br>
                    Graphic design can be used by companies to promote and sell products through advertising,
                    by websites to convey complicated information in a digestible way through infographics,
                    or by businesses to develop an identity through branding, among other things.
